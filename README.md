## 🌿 About Educode

Welcome to Educode, where monitoring student performance becomes seamless! 🎓 Educode is not just another educational app; it's your key to staying connected with your child’s academic journey. We understand three common challenges parents face: lack of access to real-time updates, difficulty in tracking progress, and limited insights into their child’s education. To address these issues, we’ve designed EduCode with a range of powerful and user-friendly features.
